Oh my god, I just got out of Silent Zone and my brain feels like... like mashed potatoes, you know? You wouldn't believe this movie. My back’s stiff from those cursed chairs and there’s popcorn stuck to my sweater. Typical, right? Why do I never learn? Anyway, the movie, yeah, so, it's like nothing makes sense but everything makes perfect sense all at once.

> The sound design, like, it's less of a soundtrack and more of a voice in the back of your mind whispering secrets. Like, at one point, I swear, the rustling of leaves was more emotional than the last film's climax that I saw. Remember who asked if they should watch the movie or download it? Yeah, def watch it in the theater if you can — the vibes, man, they were electric, like sticking a fork in a toaster.

That scene with the running — remember? — when all goes silent except for these heartbeats pounding? Theater was falling apart with noise but still, my heart felt exposed. All I can recall is the actress’s mascara running like a wet painting, and it’s just so raw. It hit me, you know, like when you’re trying to do a winged liner and it goes wrong, but maybe it’s the right kind of wrong, the beautiful disaster you actually need? Gosh, I’m rambling.

The dialogues, hah, they're sparse, but everytime it felt like a makeup brush stroking across a face, just the perfect touch, just enough. God, the director paints emotions onto film as if they’re cheeks blushing against the cold.

> Oh yes, right just itching to tell you that ending! It’s like biting into a piece of fruit only to find.. no. Okay wait I can't, you gotta see for yourself. Download the movie once it’s available if you miss the theater run, promise me! 

My brain's still spinning — like when you blend the perfect smokey eye and go for an unintentional avant-garde look instead. No complaints though. By the way, script job was nuts, I need to remember more lines before I judge. Just, wow.

```python
def heart_reacts(feelings):
    if 'wired':
        return 'float'
    else not_found_exceptions:
        return 'dazed'
```
